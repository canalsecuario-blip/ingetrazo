"""A guide behind a wall stays behind it (issue #23, @pacaeiro).

«Guide lines are always in front of other objects, even if they are behind
the object, in the scene.» They were painted in the QPainter overlay, which
runs AFTER the render and has no depth buffer — on top was the only place
they could be.

The cheap fix does not exist: asking the pick index per sample point
(``_is_occluded``, what the snap engine uses) measured **618 µs a ray** on
the Plaza Yanque model, so ten guides would have cost 200 ms a frame. The
depth buffer already knows, for free, so the lines moved into the GL pass —
same recipe as the axes, world-space dashes and depth-write off.
